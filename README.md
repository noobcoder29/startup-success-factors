# startup-success-factors
The project aimed to determine factors responsible for the success of startups using meta-analysis which is an extremely popular statistical concept for field studies.
It is primarily used in medical research for factor identification of diseases but we implemented a similar novel method in the field of entrepreneurship. We performed meta analysis on close to 250 field studies based on machine learning and survey based analysis of startups. We used Cochrane Heterogeneity and Standard Error values to evaluate clusters with minimum heterogeneity and figure out the best algorithms to use in any predictive model to predict success factors.

This is a first of it's kind holistic study conducted by using meta analysis in entrepreneurship. Such advanced statistical methods are crucial in the field of new ventures for the entrepreneurs, investors and policy makers as historical data about startups are often unavailable as they are new to the environment hence, it's important to understand emperically how sustainable and impactful their business strategy will be based on the factors they prioritize.

For confidential reasons of research, the program of the statistical model implemented has not been uploaded since there is further work progressing on the same. However if interested to collab, or require any information, don't hesitate to email.
